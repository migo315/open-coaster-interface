# Open Coaster Interface (OCI)
**Open Coaster Interface** is an GraphQL API for themeparks provided by [coaster.cloud](https://coaster.cloud). This repository
introduce to the API and show some examples. In addition, we handle all issues, suggestions and provide a change log.

### Important: API shutdown

After 3 years of development and maintenance, the project get some major changes. The project goals will also change.
The project should be smaller overall so that I have less effort. Since the API requires a lot of maintenance and only a few people using it, 
it will also switched off. The amount of data fields will be reduced too.

I'm really sorry - but since I manage the project entirely as a hobby and want to keep costs and effort low in the future, I have to make some changes.

The API will be switched off on Friday evening, June 5, 2020.
